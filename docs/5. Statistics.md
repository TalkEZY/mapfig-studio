# Statistics and Analytics

petiole 3.0.1 adds a second PostgreSQL database for storing map usage and view statistics.

The activity page (shown below) allows for multi-level drill down by API/User, Map, Timeframe, Browser, and Country. 

A CSV can also be downloaded for the selected parameters with each individual map view and data per line.

The statistics database can be disabled if not wanted (see instructions)
