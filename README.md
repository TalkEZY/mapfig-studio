## Description

petiole is free, Open Source (GPLv3) application for creating, editing, managing, and deploying Leaflet maps.

The server is tile-agnostic, allowing you to use any tile provider.  A group of 10 tile providers and a tile group are created on installation.

The application supports Markers, Lines, Squares, and Polygons.

Maps can be exported via iframe code, HTML, BootStrap, or called via URL or API.

The Studio includes CMS plugins for WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Omeka to allow you to import, manage, and display of maps 
within your CMS.

SDKs for Android, iOS, nodejs, PHP, Windows, and python are available.

A WYSIWYG editor is included for adding formatted text, images, and links to InfoBoxes. 

In addition to bundling a large number of leaflet plugins (Measure, Search, Clustering, Export, Playback), some of the key features 
of petiole includes Image Overlay, IntroBox Slider, InfoSlider, Legend, Password-Protection, SVG Maps, 
Cross-Reference (insert link to one object from another), and CSV Processing with Advanced Filters. 

petiole also includes multi-user support, Projects, and Collaboration.
