## Description

petiole is a free, Open Source (GPLv3) server for creating, developing, managing, and deploying Leaflet maps.

The server is tile-agnostic, allowing you to use any map tile provider.  

The application supports Markers, Lines, Squares, and Polygons. Maps can be created and edited 'free-hand' as well as via CSV/Table.

Maps can be exported via iframe code, HTML, BootStrap, or via URL (public and password-protected) or via API.

petiole also includes integrated API plugins for WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and Omeka.

A WYSIWYG editor is included for adding formatted text, images, and links to InfoBoxes. 

In addition to bundling a large number of leaflet plugins (Measure, Search, Clustering, Export, Playback), some of the key features of petiole include Image Overlay, IntroBox Slider, InfoSlider, Legend, Password-Protection, SVG Maps, Cross-Reference (insert link to one object from another), and CSV Processing with Advanced Filters. 

petiole also includes multi-user support, Projects, and Collaboration.
